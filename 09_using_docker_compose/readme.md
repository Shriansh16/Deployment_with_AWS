1. services:
This section defines the different containers (or services) that will run in your Docker application.

2. app:
This is the name of the service. You can refer to this service using this name when running commands (e.g., docker-compose logs app).

3. build:
This tells Docker to build an image for this service from a Dockerfile.

4. context: .

The context specifies the location of the Dockerfile and application files.
The . means the current directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located).
Docker will use this directory's contents to build the image.
5. ports:

This maps the ports between the host machine and the container.
"80:5000" means:
80 → Port on your local machine (host).
5000 → Port inside the container (where the app is running).
So, if the app inside the container runs on port 5000, you can access it by going to http://localhost:80 on your browser.
